# ETL-project

This project takes movies that have been rated by two different sources and compares those ratings.

## Data Extraction

We decided to evaluate movies that have been rated by two popular sources, IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. Our data set for IMDB ratings came from <a href="https://data.world/eng/imdb-movies">data.world</a> and the data set for Rotten Tomatoes ratings from <a href="hhttps://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney?select=MoviesOnStreamingPlatforms_updated.csv">www.kaggle.com.</a>
